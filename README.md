# FNAFuller
This is a game project I am going to be making in Unity, based off of an 
obscure little indie horror game you might have heard of called 
Five Nights at Freddy's. Only this is WPI themed: Five nights at Fuller!

This is going to be a very basic game for me to work on as a personal project, 
because I feel like I have not done enough in trying to make games.
